# Project Development Strategy

## `Week-Converter`

### Description

This is a collaborative HTML, CSS and JavaScript project. It consists of single dynamic webpage and several JS functions with the appropriate handlers. It uses a single global variable.
It could be useful to boost team-developing skills, to practice the knowledge of JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.
